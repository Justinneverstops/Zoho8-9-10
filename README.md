8.Given an array nums of positive integers of size N. Find all distinct digits present in nums.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [131, 11, 48]
Output: 1 3 4 8
Explanation: 1, 3, 4, and 8 are only distinct
digits that can be extracted from the numbers
of the array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [111, 222, 333, 4444, 666]
Output: 1 2 3 4 6
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are only distinct
digits that can be extracted from the numbers
of the array.

9.You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.
Input: arr[] = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.


10.Problem statement
Given an array 'arr' with 'n' elements, the task is to rotate the array to the left by 'k' steps, where 'k' is non-negative.



Example:
'arr '= [1,2,3,4,5]
'k' = 1  rotated array = [2,3,4,5,1]
'k' = 2  rotated array = [3,4,5,1,2]
'k' = 3  rotated array = [4,5,1,2,3] and so on.
